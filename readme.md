# ngMaterial Seed Built Using AngularJS Generator [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/i-heart-php/angular-material-seed.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/i-heart-php/angular-material-seed)

## Begin

Install deps: `npm cache clean && npm install && bower install`

Run `grunt` for building and deployment. Created `.ftppass` for ftp login info.

and `grunt serve` for preview and livereload.

## Generators

Available generators:

* [angular:controller](#controller)
* [angular:directive](#directive)
* [angular:filter](#filter)
* [angular:route](#route)
* [angular:service](#service)
* [angular:provider](#service)
* [angular:factory](#service)
* [angular:value](#service)
* [angular:constant](#service)
* [angular:decorator](#decorator)
* [angular:view](#view)

**Note: Yeoman Generator is to be run from the root directory of this app.**

### Routes
Generates a controller and view, and configures a route in `app/scripts/app.js` connecting them.

Example:
```bash
yo angular:route myroute
```

Produces `app/scripts/controllers/myroute.js`:
```javascript
angular.module('myMod').controller('MyrouteCtrl', function ($scope) {
  // ...
});
```

Produces `app/views/myroute.html`:
```html
<p>This is the myroute view</p>
```

**Explicitly provide route URI**

Example:
```bash
yo angular:route myRoute --uri=my/route
```

Produces controller and view as above and adds a route to `app/scripts/app.js`
with URI `my/route`

### Controllers
Generates a controller in `app/scripts/controllers`.

Example:
```bash
yo angular:controller user
```

Produces `app/scripts/controllers/user.js`:
```javascript
angular.module('myMod').controller('UserCtrl', function ($scope) {
  // ...
});
```
### Directive
Generates a directive in `app/scripts/directives`.

Example:
```bash
yo angular:directive myDirective
```

Produces `app/scripts/directives/myDirective.js`:
```javascript
angular.module('myMod').directive('myDirective', function () {
  return {
    template: '<div></div>',
    restrict: 'E',
    link: function postLink(scope, element, attrs) {
      element.text('this is the myDirective directive');
    }
  };
});
```

### Filter
Generates a filter in `app/scripts/filters`.

Example:
```bash
yo angular:filter myFilter
```

Produces `app/scripts/filters/myFilter.js`:
```javascript
angular.module('myMod').filter('myFilter', function () {
  return function (input) {
    return 'myFilter filter:' + input;
  };
});
```

### Views
Generates an HTML view file in `app/views`.

Example:
```bash
yo angular:view user
```

Produces `app/views/user.html`:
```html
<p>This is the user view</p>
```

### Services
Generates an AngularJS service.

Example:
```bash
yo angular:service myService
```

Produces `app/scripts/services/myService.js`:
```javascript
angular.module('myMod').service('myService', function () {
  // ...
});
```

You can also do `yo angular:factory`, `yo angular:provider`, `yo angular:value`, and `yo angular:constant` for other types of services.

### Decorators
Generates an AngularJS service decorator.

Example:
```bash
yo angular:decorator serviceName
```

Produces `app/scripts/decorators/serviceNameDecorator.js`:
```javascript
angular.module('myMod').config(function ($provide) {
    $provide.decorator('serviceName', function ($delegate) {
      // ...
      return $delegate;
    });
  });
```

## Options
In general, these options can be applied to any generator, though they only affect generators that produce scripts.

### CoffeeScript
For generators that output scripts, the `--coffee` option will output CoffeeScript instead of JavaScript.

For example:
```bash
yo angular:controller user --coffee
```

Produces `app/scripts/controller/user.coffee`:
```coffeescript
angular.module('myMod')
  .controller 'UserCtrl', ($scope) ->
```

A project can mix CoffeScript and JavaScript files.

To output JavaScript files, even if CoffeeScript files exist (the default is to output CoffeeScript files if the generator finds any in the project), use `--coffee=false`.

### Minification Safe

**tl;dr**: You don't need to write annotated code as the build step will
handle it for you.

By default, generators produce unannotated code. Without annotations, AngularJS's DI system will break when minified. Typically, these annotations that make minification safe are added automatically at build-time, after application files are concatenated, but before they are minified. The annotations are important because minified code will rename variables, making it impossible for AngularJS to infer module names based solely on function parameters.

The recommended build process uses `ng-annotate`, a tool that automatically adds these annotations. However, if you'd rather not use it, you have to add these annotations manually yourself. Why would you do that though? If you find a bug
in the annotated code, please file an issue at [ng-annotate](https://github.com/olov/ng-annotate/issues).


### Add to Index
By default, new scripts are added to the index.html file. However, this may not always be suitable. Some use cases:

* Manually added to the file
* Auto-added by a 3rd party plugin
* Using this generator as a subgenerator

To skip adding them to the index, pass in the skip-add argument:
```bash
yo angular:service serviceName --skip-add
```

## Bower Components

The following packages are always installed by the [app](#app) generator:

* angular
* angular-mocks
* angular-scenario


The following additional modules are available as components on bower, and installable via `bower install`:

* angular-animate
* angular-aria
* angular-cookies
* angular-messages
* angular-resource
* angular-sanitize

All of these can be updated with `bower update` as new versions of AngularJS are released.

## Configuration
Yeoman generated projects can be further tweaked according to your needs by modifying project files appropriately.

### Output
You can change the `app` directory by adding a `appPath` property to `bower.json`. For instance, if you wanted to easily integrate with Express.js, you could add the following:

```json
{
  "name": "yo-test",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  ...
  "appPath": "public"
}

```
This will cause Yeoman-generated client-side files to be placed in `public`.

Note that you can also achieve the same results by adding an `--appPath` option when starting generator:
```bash
yo angular [app-name] --appPath=public
```

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
